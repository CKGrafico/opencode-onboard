Find the oldest unarchived OpenSpec change that has a completed PR, archive it, update docs, and open an archive PR. No input required.

**Steps**

1. **Prepare working tree**

   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
   DEFAULT_BRANCH="$(git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|^origin/||')"
   [ -z "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ] && DEFAULT_BRANCH="main"
   ```

   1. If the tree has uncommitted changes: `git stash push -u -m "WIP before archive"` and tell the user their work is stashed (it is restored in step 6).
   2. Sync the default branch (skip the pull if there is no `origin` remote):

   ```bash
   git switch "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" && git pull origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
   ```
